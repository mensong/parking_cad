<h3><b>9.5.2.0 - July 31, 2018</b></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Fix: Fixed an issue where Setup Factory silent installs would fail on Windows Server OS's without a GUI due to the system file 'oledlg.dll' not being present. This fix only applies to silent installs. Setups with an interface still require that system component.</li>
	<li>Fix: Made a change to Setup Factory's launcher to prevent possible DLL hijacking of system files if nefarious copies were placed in the same folder as the setup when launched. The issue was related to the default search order for system files if not defined explicitly.</li>
	<li>Fix: Fixed an issue where a file in-use error would occassionally occur when installing over existing files due to anti-virus interference.</li>
	<li>Fix: Fixed a bug in the DLL.CallFunction action where parameters weren't handled properly in 64-bit setups.</li>
	<li>Fix: Made an attempt to prevent an occassional build error from occurring duing the manifest injection step.</li>
	<li>Fix: Fixed an issue where the File.Move action's "IncludeHiddenFiles" parameter default didn't match what was being used. It now uses the correct value from the prototype when not defined.</li>
	<li>Fix: Made the Registry.GetValue action able to read REG_MULTI_SZ values containing null characters within it's data.</li>
	<li>Fix: Addressed an issue in the File.Copy and File.Move actions where if the path contained erroneous backslashes in some locations, it would result in unpredictable file attributes being set. It may also result in the source folder being deleted in the File.Move action.</li>
	<li>Fix: Fixed a bug where dragging and dropping a folder would cause files in sibling folders to be added as well.</li>
	<li>Fix: Fixed a bug where files within folder names starting with '.' would be skipped when adding folder trees of files to the project or using folder references which would cause them to be skipped during the build.</li>
	<li>Fix: Fixed a bug where command line arguments starting with 'S' would cause silent install/uninstalls if enabled.</li>
	<li>Fix: Made a change to try to prevent a rare design-time crash from occurring when scanning some .dll/.ocx archive files for DLLRegisterServer interface support.</li>
	<li>Fix: Made the 'Clipboard.IsTextAvailable' plugin action return false if there was a text entry on the clipboard, but it's data was empty. Updated version to 2.0.2.0.</li>
	<li>Fix: Changed the behavior of the design-time properties of the Edit control on Custom screens to make it clear that 'Multiline' is not supported for 'Password' input styles. The Password input style is only valid for single-line edit controls.</li>
</ul>


<h3><b>9.5.1.0 - March 3, 2016</b></h3>

	<li>Feature: Added a few items to the System.GetOSProductInfo action's constants.</li>
	<li>Change: Removed support for signing with signcode.exe, instead use signtool.exe.</li>
	<li>Fix: Made several changes in order to prevent errors that may occur due to anti-virus scanning when launching the setup and installing files.</li>
	<li>Fix: Fixed a bug where registering/unregistering fonts could hang the setup on some systems.</li>
	<li>Fix: Fixed a bug where temporary font files were not be deleted from the setup's temp folder after the setup completes.</li>
	<li>Fix: Fixed a bug where session variables set via an uninstall INI file on the command line weren't being set in the uninstall.</li>
	<li>Fix: Fixed a bug where if a custom screen contained a GroupBox control, tabbing through the controls failed to work properly.</li>
	<li>Fix: Fixed a bug where using the UninstallData.RemoveItem action with the UNINDATA_SUPPORTFILES item type wasn't removing the item from the uninstall's configuration file.</li>
	<li>Fix: Recompiled the distributed copies of lua5.1.dll to pass the binary analyzer tests DBCheck and NXCheck.</li>
	<li>Fix: Changed references in Setup Factory from Windows Server 10 to Windows Server 2016.</li>
